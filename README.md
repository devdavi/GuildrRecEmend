# GuildrRecEmended
 Wow Addon for Guild Recruitment.

This addon project is free to use and modify, go ham! I started working on this project as a way to get a bit more experience in lua coding as well as create a fully controlled addon to help with guild recruitment. This initial version contains the exact code from the original addon that received its last update in 2018. **As such, this addon will not work in WoW v. 9.0+ in its current form.**

### This addon is built on the abandoned project "Guild Recruitment Helper"

This very basic addon was developed to help with guild recruitment across different realms. It can announce your guild recruitment information to Trade and LFG channels. You can specify message, channels and announce interval.

Please respect server and the people playing on it. Set your announce interval and spam protection settings accordingly. Keep your message clean, simple and short.
